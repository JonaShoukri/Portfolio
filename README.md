# Portfolio

This is the code to my personal portfolio. I created it using React, Vite and Framer Motion. I also set up a CI/CD pipeline using Vercel for hosting in order to make sure the hosted version always reflects the newest updated project and automatically updates instead of requiring a manual update.
